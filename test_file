moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources .
every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers .
in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him .
in the movies , you end up with films like " spawn " , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors .
